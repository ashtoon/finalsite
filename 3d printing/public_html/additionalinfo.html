        <h1>How it works</h1>
        <p> the first step to making a 3d print is to design a digital model of the object you wish to create. you can also download a design that has been made by another 3d printer owner and apply it to yours. 3d printing is characterized as additive manufacturing, which means a solid object is produced by layering multiple layers of material.
            this material can be plastic, metal, rubber or even paper. </p>
